<main class="hero content"><h1>How EMI Is Calculated</h1><p>EMI is calculated using principal amount, interest rate, and tenure. The formula standardizes monthly repayment so borrowers can plan obligations. This guide explains the formula in plain language and shows why changing any one variable shifts repayment burden.</p><h2>Formula Components</h2><p>P is principal, r is monthly interest rate, and n is number of monthly installments. Monthly rate equals annual rate divided by 12 and then by 100.</p><h2>Why Borrowers Should Understand EMI Math</h2><p>Understanding EMI helps borrowers compare options rationally instead of selecting based on only sanction amount. It supports better affordability decisions for both households and businesses.</p><h2>Practical Scenario View</h2><p>If tenure increases, EMI typically reduces but total interest increases. If rate increases, EMI and total repayment both rise. If principal increases, installment burden rises materially. Use the calculator to test scenarios before application.</p><div class="quick-links"><a href="/emi-calculator/">Use Main EMI Calculator</a><a href="/business-loan-emi-calculator/">Business Loan EMI Page</a><a href="/contact.html">Contact Advisory Team</a></div></main>
